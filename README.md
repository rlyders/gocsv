# go-csv
Golang CSV parser that respects quotes, escaped quotes, escaped newlines, escaped escape chars, and double-double quotes.

I wasn't able to find a parser written in Go that respected quotes, escaped characters, and double-double quotes. After testing several go CSV parsers, I just wrote this one to serve my needs.
